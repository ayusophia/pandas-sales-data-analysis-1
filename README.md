This Python script analyzes sales data using Pandas.

It creates a DataFrame from a dictionary containing product names, sales figures, and profit margins.
The script then performs several operations on the DataFrame including:
Calculating total sales and total profit
Determining average profit per sale
Identifying the highest selling product
Finding all profitable products (profit > $20)
Finally, the script saves the DataFrame to a CSV file named 'output2.csv'
